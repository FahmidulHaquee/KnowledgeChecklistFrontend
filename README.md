Upon login, they are directed to the student dashboard. This page contains a welcome section, progress bar, side navigation bar as well as the learning objectives under each topic. Within each learning objective, three buttons can be found side-by-side. These buttons related to the level of confidence that each trainee has with respect to that learning objective.
